# Multithreading
Programs that utilize multithreading  

Tutoring (Linux Only): Using POSIX threads to mimic a TA tutoring students. TA will either sleep when no students are present, wait for next student, and tutor a student. TA is defined by a thread and each student is defined by a thread. Program ends when all students end their thread and then TA. <br/ >
To Compile: gcc -pthread TA.c <br/ >

ChangeLog: <br />
